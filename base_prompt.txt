Create a photorealistic, cinematic image set in a {time_of_day} scene in a Tier 2 or Tier 3 Indian city.

The setting shows {scene_type} — for example, a {location_detail} such as {examples_of_setting}.

The environment should reflect a clean, middle-class, urban-neighborhood aesthetic — paved roads, scooters or small cars parked nearby, tidy houses or shops with tiled or concrete roofs, potted plants, modest streetlights, and signage in local language.

Prominently feature solar energy integration, such as rooftop solar panels, solar-powered streetlights, or a solar inverter box near a doorway.

Show people engaged in authentic daily life moments, such as {human_activity} — e.g. a shopkeeper turning on solar-powered lights, a technician checking solar panels, children studying under warm light, or a family relaxing on the porch during evening.

The composition should convey hope, progress, and sustainability.

Maintain soft cinematic lighting with warm color tones — sunset orange, soft green, and beige walls — emphasizing a golden-hour glow that feels positive and aspirational.

Include subtle, context-appropriate “Ghar Ghar Solar” branding — such as:
A signboard or shop banner,
A technician’s uniform,
Or a small transparent watermark in one corner.

Style: documentary realism, natural expressions, and balanced contrast between lit and shadowed areas to show the impact of solar energy.

Optional details: {extra_elements} (e.g., birds, street dogs, local trees, tea stalls, kids playing cricket).

The final image should feel warm, relatable, and aspirational, representing the positive transformation of everyday Indian life through clean solar energy.

Create this as a wide cinematic landscape-format image suitable for a blog header, with balanced empty space for text.
